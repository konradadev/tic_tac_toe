# tic_tac_toe
A simple Tic Tac Toe command-line game written in Ruby.

To play the game you need to have ruby installed.
If you're on Linux simply download the script and run it with the command:

ruby path_to_script/script.rb

Make sure to replace path_to_script with a path to the downloaded file.
You can also cd into the directory with the script.rb file and simply run:

ruby script.rb

Currently known problems (the game is fully functional, however there are some caveats within the game's code):
- code could use some cleanup, fe. Game class is quite long
- the way display_board function works is not ideal, it should work in most monospace terminals though

These problems may be solved in the future but keep in mind that this is a simple intro to programming script that I may forget to revisit.
